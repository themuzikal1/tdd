<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I need to write a console application that calculates tax and import duty on items from list.
* I do not need to implement any input mechanism, UI or data storage. 
* I need to focus on code quality and attention to details, not the quantity of code.
* I may use frameworks and/or tools. 
* Basic tales tax is applicable at 10% of all non-exempt goods.
* Import duty of 5% is applicable at a rate of 5%.
* I need to include unit testing. 
* Where should I start?
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Research JUNIT and become familiar with it. 
* Attend Craig's session to get a jump start on TDD exercise. 
* Search for resources to help with TDD
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Write unit tests that fails.
* Write code, retest to get passing
* Refactor.
* I will implement scanner and each item will be entered individually. 

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* This assigment proved to be harder than I expected. 
* I had blockers concerning what to test and how code finished code should look. 
* Although I did test, I feel like, I should have more test. 
* I am still trying to wrap my head around TDD and testing.
